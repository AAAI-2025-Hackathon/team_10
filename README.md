# Project Description
This project applies machine learning to analyze MRI scans and clinical data from the IDEAS dataset (doi:10.18112/openneuro.ds005602.v1.0.0), aiming to uncover patterns in brain structure related to drug-resistant focal epilepsy. By leveraging imaging and demographic data, we seek to improve lesion detection, identify biomarkers, and explore factors influencing surgical outcomes. Our approach combines deep learning and statistical modeling to enhance the understanding of epilepsy and support clinical decision-making.


# Data downloading

In this project we use the IDEAS (The Imaging Database for Epilepsy And Surgery) obtained from https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005602/versions/1.0.0.

You can download the dataset by executing the ds005602-1.0.0.sh script from OpenNeuro git bash or any other tool for executing bash scripts:

When using VSCode you can open a new Terminal and select the arrow next to the "+" sign on the bottom right corner of the terminal UI in VSCode and select "Git bash" where you can just type the following command to download the dataset.

```
sh ds005602-1.0.0.sh
```
